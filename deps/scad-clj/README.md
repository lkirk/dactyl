NOTE: this is a vendored version of [farrellm/scad-clj](https://github.com/farrellm/scad-clj/), modified to use more modern dependencies, avoiding warnings on newer versions of clojure.

OpenSCAD DSL in Clojure

Functions generally mirror [OpenSCAD](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language), with the following notable exceptions:
* All angles are in radians
* All primitive forms are centered at the origin

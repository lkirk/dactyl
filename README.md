## Dactyl Manuform

This is my personal fork of (tshort/dactyl-keyboard)[https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard]. Please refer to the original for licensing, etc. This version is parameterized by config files and does not require any patching or `lein`.

## Development

This project uses the [clj](https://clojure.org/reference/clojure_cli) command line tool with [deps.edn](https://clojure.org/reference/deps_edn) for dependency management.

Development can be done in the REPL:

```
clj -M:repl
```

## Running

```
